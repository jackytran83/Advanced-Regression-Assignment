# Linear Regression Assignment 
> This is an assignment of one master students who are participating Master of machine learning, a joint program between Upgrad and Liverpool John Moorse University. This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 

## Problem Statement

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

 

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

 

The company wants to know:

    Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

    How well those variables describe the price of a house.

 

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 

## Business Goal:
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
